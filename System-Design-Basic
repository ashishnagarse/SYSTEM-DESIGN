# Domain Name and IP Address

## What is a Domain Name?
A **domain name** is a human-readable address used to access websites, such as `www.example.com`. Instead of remembering complex numerical addresses, users type in a domain name.

## What is an IP Address?
An **IP address** is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It helps route requests to the correct web server.  
**Example:** `192.168.1.1`

# Single User Setup

## How a User Accesses a Website
1. A user enters a website URL in a browser or a mobile app.
2. The request goes to the **Domain Name System (DNS)**.
3. The DNS translates the domain name into an IP address.
4. The request is forwarded to the **web server**.
5. The web server processes the request and sends back a response (webpage or data).

# Understanding Traffic

## What is Web Traffic?
- Web traffic refers to the number of users accessing a server at the same time.
- Just like a **restaurant** gets multiple customers at once, a **web server** handles multiple user requests simultaneously.

## Handling Multiple Users
- If too many users try to access a website at once, the **server can become slow or unresponsive**.

# Web and Mobile Applications

## Sources of Traffic
- **Web Applications:** Websites accessed via browsers.
- **Mobile Applications:** Apps that communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol.

## Technology Used
- **Web Applications:** Built using server-side languages like **PHP, Python, Node.js**.
- **Mobile Applications:** Use **APIs** to fetch data from the server.

# Need for Scaling

## Why Scale?
- When a website becomes **successful**, more users will access it.
- A single server may **not be enough** to handle the load.
- **Scaling** helps distribute the load across multiple servers.
