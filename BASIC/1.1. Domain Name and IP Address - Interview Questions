# 🌐 Domain Name and IP Address - Interview Questions

## 1. What is a Domain Name? 📌
A **domain name** is a human-readable address used to access websites, such as `www.example.com`. Instead of remembering complex numerical addresses, users type in a domain name.

## 2. What is an IP Address? 🌍
An **IP address** is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It helps route requests to the correct web server.
**Example:** `192.168.1.1`

## 3. How does DNS work? 🔄
The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates domain names into IP addresses. The process involves:
1. The user enters a URL in the browser. 🌐
2. The request is sent to a DNS server. 📡
3. The DNS resolves the domain name into an IP address. 🔍
4. The request is forwarded to the web server. 🖥️
5. The web server processes and responds with the requested webpage. 📄

## 4. What are the different types of IP addresses? 🏷️
- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):** Uses a 32-bit address format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):** Uses a 128-bit address format (e.g., `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`).

## 5. What is the difference between a public and private IP address? 🔐
- **Public IP Address:** Assigned by ISPs, used for external communication over the internet.
- **Private IP Address:** Used within a local network (e.g., `192.168.0.1`).

## 6. What is a Subnet Mask? 🛑
A **subnet mask** defines the range of IP addresses within a network. Example:
- IP Address: `192.168.1.1`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`

## 7. What is the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses? ⚡
- **Static IP Address:** Fixed and manually assigned.
- **Dynamic IP Address:** Automatically assigned by DHCP servers and can change over time.

## 8. What is the difference between TCP and UDP? 🔀
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable, connection-based, ensures data is received correctly.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Faster, connectionless, does not guarantee delivery.

## 9. What is Reverse DNS Lookup? 🔄
Reverse DNS lookup is used to find the domain name associated with an IP address.

## 10. What are the main components of a domain name? 🏗️
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** `.com`, `.org`, `.net`
- **Second-Level Domain:** `example` in `example.com`
- **Subdomain:** `www` in `www.example.com`

## 11. What are some common DNS record types? 📜
- **A Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record:** Alias for another domain.
- **MX Record:** Mail exchange record for email servers.
- **TXT Record:** Stores text information (e.g., verification codes).

## 12. What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)? 🚀
A **CDN** is a network of servers that cache and deliver content based on user locations to improve load times.

## 13. What is Load Balancing? ⚖️
Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource usage and prevent overload.

## 14. What is Latency? ⏳
Latency refers to the delay in data transmission between the sender and receiver.

## 15. What are HTTP and HTTPS? 🔐
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Standard protocol for web communication.
- **HTTPS (Secure HTTP):** Uses encryption (SSL/TLS) for secure communication.

## 16. What is the role of an ISP (Internet Service Provider)? 🌎
An **ISP** provides internet access and assigns public IP addresses to users.

## 17. What is a Proxy Server? 🛡️
A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between the client and the internet, often used for security and caching.

## 18. What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network)? 🔒
A **VPN** encrypts internet traffic, providing privacy and security by masking the user’s real IP address.

## 19. What is NAT (Network Address Translation)? 🔄
**NAT** allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address.

## 20. What is the difference between a domain and a hostname? 🌍
- **Domain Name:** The main address (`example.com`).
- **Hostname:** A specific server within a domain (`server.example.com`).
