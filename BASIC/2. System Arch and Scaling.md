# Server Architecture and Scaling

## Single Server Limitations
A single server can only handle a limited number of requests at a time. As traffic increases, it can become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times or crashes.

## Scaling Solutions

### Vertical Scaling
- Upgrading the existing server's hardware (CPU, RAM, etc.).
- Limited scalability and can be costly.

### Horizontal Scaling
- Adding more servers to distribute the load.
- More effective for handling increased traffic.

## Separation of Concerns
Separating the **application server** (handles user requests) from the **database server** (manages data) allows independent optimization and scaling.

## Load Balancing
A **load balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload and improving performance and reliability.

# Database Selection

## Types of Databases

### Relational Databases (SQL)
- Examples: **MySQL, PostgreSQL**
- Structured, uses SQL for queries.
- Suitable for complex queries and transactions.

### NoSQL Databases
- Examples: **MongoDB, Cassandra**
- More flexible, handles unstructured data.
- Ideal for large-scale applications needing speed and scalability.

## Choosing the Right Database

- **Structured data with relationships?** → Use a relational database.
- **Unstructured/semi-structured data?** → Use NoSQL.
- **Need scalability?** → NoSQL offers better horizontal scaling.
- **Strong consistency required?** → Choose relational databases.
- **Eventual consistency acceptable?** → NoSQL is a good option.

## Performance Considerations

- Analyze **read/write patterns** to choose an optimized database.
- **Indexing strategies** play a crucial role in improving performance.

# Interview Preparation

## Common Questions
- Why did you choose a particular database for a project?
- Explain the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Discuss scaling strategies and handling increased traffic.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Be ready to share experiences in making architecture or database decisions.
- Discuss challenges faced and how they were overcome.

## Conclusion
Understanding **server architecture**, the importance of **separating application and database servers**, and making **informed database decisions** is key to building scalable and efficient applications.
