# 🌐 Domain Name and IP Address  

## 🔹 What is a Domain Name?  
A **domain name** is a human-readable address used to access websites, such as `www.example.com`. Instead of remembering complex numerical addresses, users type in a domain name.  

### 🏷️ Key Features of a Domain Name:  
- **User-friendly 🌍** – Easy to remember compared to an IP address.  
- **DNS Mapping 🔄** – Converts a domain name into an IP address.  
- **Hierarchical System 📂** – Includes **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)** like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`.  
- **Unique Identifier 🆔** – Every website has a unique domain name.  

## 🔹 What is an IP Address?  
An **IP address** is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It helps route requests to the correct web server.  

### 🖥️ Types of IP Addresses:  
- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol v4) 🔢** – Example: `192.168.1.1` (32-bit).  
- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol v6) 🔠** – Example: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334` (128-bit).  

## 🤔 Interview Questions  
1. What is the difference between a **domain name and an IP address**?  
2. How does **DNS resolution** work?  
3. What is the **difference between IPv4 and IPv6**?  
4. What happens when you **enter a URL in a browser**?  
5. How does a **CDN (Content Delivery Network) work** in relation to domain names?

# 🧑‍💻 Single User Setup  

## 🔄 How a User Accesses a Website  
1. User enters a **URL** in the browser.  
2. The browser **sends a request** to the **DNS server**.  
3. The **DNS resolves** the domain name to an **IP address**.  
4. The request is **sent to the correct web server**.  
5. The server **processes the request** and returns the **webpage/data**.  

### 🔗 Important Components  
- **Client Device 📱💻** – Sends requests to a web server.  
- **DNS Server 🌎** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  
- **Web Server 🖥️** – Hosts and serves the website content.  

## 🤔 Interview Questions  
1. What are the **steps of accessing a website**?  
2. What is the **role of DNS in website access**?  
3. What is the **difference between a web server and an application server**?  
4. How do **browsers cache websites**, and why is it important?  
5. What is the purpose of **HTTP status codes** (e.g., 200, 404, 500)?

# 📊 Understanding Traffic  

## 🌍 What is Web Traffic?  
Web traffic refers to the **number of users accessing a server** at the same time.  
Just like a **restaurant 🍽️** serves multiple customers, a **web server 🖥️** handles multiple user requests simultaneously.  

### 📈 Types of Web Traffic  
1. **Organic Traffic 🔍** – Visitors coming from search engines (e.g., Google).  
2. **Direct Traffic 🏁** – Users entering the URL manually.  
3. **Referral Traffic 🔗** – Visitors coming from external links.  
4. **Paid Traffic 💰** – Visitors from advertisements (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.).  

## 🚦 Handling Multiple Users  
- If too many users try to access a website at once, the **server can become slow or unresponsive 🛑**.  
- **High-traffic websites** use **scaling strategies** to handle large user loads.  

## 🤔 Interview Questions  
1. What is **web traffic**, and how is it measured?  
2. How does a **server handle multiple requests simultaneously**?  
3. What are **load balancing techniques** to handle high traffic?  
4. What is **rate limiting**, and why is it used?  
5. How does **caching** improve web performance?

# 💻 Web and Mobile Applications  

## 🚀 Sources of Traffic  
- **Web Applications 🖥️** – Websites accessed via browsers.  
- **Mobile Applications 📱** – Apps that communicate with servers using APIs.  

## ⚙️ Technology Used  
### Web Applications 🌐  
- **Backend:** Built using server-side languages like **PHP, Python, Node.js**.  
- **Frontend:** Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  

### Mobile Applications 📱  
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 🔄** – Used to fetch data from the server.  
- **Mobile Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) 📊** – Firebase, AWS Amplify.  

## 🤔 Interview Questions  
1. What is the **difference between a web app and a mobile app**?  
2. How do **APIs work** in mobile applications?  
3. What is the difference between **REST and GraphQL APIs**?  
4. How do **mobile apps communicate with servers**?  
5. What are **best practices for securing APIs**?

# 📈 Need for Scaling  

## 🤔 Why Scale?  
- As a website becomes **successful**, more users will access it.  
- A single server may **not be enough** to handle the load.  
- **Scaling** helps distribute the load across multiple servers.  

### 🔍 Signs Your Application Needs Scaling  
- **Slow Response Times ⏳** – Pages take longer to load.  
- **Increased Server Load 🚦** – High CPU and memory usage.  
- **Frequent Downtime 🛑** – Users face connectivity issues.  
- **High Latency 🌍** – Global users experience slow loading.  

## 🔄 Scaling Strategies  
### 1️⃣ Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)  
- **Upgrading** the existing server (CPU, RAM, Storage).  
- **Limited by hardware constraints**.  

### 2️⃣ Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)  
- **Adding more servers** to handle traffic.  
- **More cost-effective and scalable**.  

### 3️⃣ Load Balancing  
- **Distributes traffic** among multiple servers.  
- Prevents **overloading of a single server**.  

### 4️⃣ Caching  
- Stores **frequently accessed data** in memory (Redis, Memcached).  
- **Reduces database queries** and speeds up responses.  

## 🤔 Interview Questions  
1. What is the **difference between vertical and horizontal scaling**?  
2. How does a **load balancer work**?  
3. What are the **benefits of caching**, and which caching strategies do you know?  
4. What are **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**, and how do they improve performance?  
5. What is **eventual consistency**, and when is it acceptable?
