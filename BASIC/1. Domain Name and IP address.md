# 🌐 Domain Name and IP Address

## 🔎 What is a Domain Name?
A **domain name** is a human-readable address used to access websites, such as `www.example.com`. Instead of remembering complex numerical addresses, users type in a domain name.

## 🖥️ What is an IP Address?
An **IP address** is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It helps route requests to the correct web server.  
**Example:** `192.168.1.1`

# 👤 Single User Setup

## 🚀 How a User Accesses a Website
1. A user enters a website URL in a browser or a mobile app.  
2. The request goes to the **Domain Name System (DNS) 🌍**.  
3. The DNS translates the domain name into an **IP address 🔢**.  
4. The request is forwarded to the **web server 🖥️**.  
5. The web server processes the request and sends back a response (webpage or data).

# 📊 Understanding Traffic

## 🔄 What is Web Traffic?
- Web traffic refers to the number of users accessing a server at the same time.  
- Just like a **restaurant 🍽️** gets multiple customers at once, a **web server 🌐** handles multiple user requests simultaneously.  

## 🛑 Handling Multiple Users
- If too many users try to access a website at once, the **server can become slow 🐢 or unresponsive ❌**.

# 📱 Web and Mobile Applications

## 🌍 Sources of Traffic
- **Web Applications 🖥️:** Websites accessed via browsers.  
- **Mobile Applications 📱:** Apps that communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol.  

## 🛠️ Technology Used
- **Web Applications 💻:** Built using server-side languages like **PHP, Python, Node.js**.  
- **Mobile Applications 📡:** Use **APIs 🔗** to fetch data from the server.

# 📈 Need for Scaling

## ❓ Why Scale?
- When a website becomes **successful 🏆**, more users will access it.  
- A single server may **not be enough ❗** to handle the load.  
- **Scaling 📊** helps distribute the load across multiple servers.
