# 🏢 Server Architecture and Scaling - Interview Questions

## 1. What are the key components of server architecture? 🖥️
- **Web Server:** Handles HTTP requests and serves web pages.
- **Application Server:** Processes business logic.
- **Database Server:** Manages data storage and retrieval.
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic among multiple servers.
- **Cache System:** Stores frequently accessed data to improve speed.

## 2. What is Vertical Scaling? ⬆️
- **Definition:** Increasing the capacity of a single server by upgrading hardware (CPU, RAM, Storage).
- **Pros:** Simple implementation, no changes in architecture.
- **Cons:** Limited scalability, expensive, potential downtime during upgrades.

## 3. What is Horizontal Scaling? ⬅️➡️
- **Definition:** Adding more servers to distribute the load.
- **Pros:** Handles high traffic efficiently, no single point of failure.
- **Cons:** Requires load balancing, complex management.

## 4. What is Load Balancing? ⚖️
- **Definition:** A technique that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
- **Types:**
  - **Round Robin:** Rotates requests evenly among servers.
  - **Least Connections:** Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
  - **IP Hashing:** Assigns users to a specific server based on their IP address.

## 5. What are the advantages of using a Load Balancer? 🚀
- Improves performance and reliability.
- Prevents server overload.
- Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

## 6. What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)? 🌍
- **Definition:** A distributed network of servers that caches content closer to users.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces latency.
  - Improves website load times.
  - Reduces bandwidth consumption.
  - Protects against DDoS attacks.

## 7. What is Caching? 🔄
- **Definition:** Storing frequently used data in memory to speed up requests.
- **Types:**
  - **Browser Caching:** Stores web assets on the client side.
  - **Server Caching:** Uses cache servers to reduce database queries.
  - **CDN Caching:** Caches content across geographically distributed servers.

## 8. What are the types of databases used in server architecture? 🗃️
- **Relational Databases (SQL):** Structured, supports complex queries (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases:** Flexible, scalable, handles unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

## 9. What is Database Replication? 🔀
- **Definition:** Copying data from one database to another for backup or load balancing.
- **Types:**
  - **Master-Slave Replication:** One main database (master) writes data, and multiple replicas (slaves) read data.
  - **Multi-Master Replication:** Multiple databases handle read and write requests.

## 10. What is a Microservices Architecture? 🏢
- **Definition:** A software design pattern where applications are broken down into small, independent services.
- **Advantages:**
  - Scalability.
  - Fault isolation.
  - Faster development and deployment.
- **Challenges:**
  - Complex communication.
  - Increased resource usage.

## 11. What are some common Scaling Strategies? 📈
- **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adds/removes servers based on demand.
- **Database Sharding:** Divides databases into smaller pieces for better performance.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic to prevent server overload.
- **Edge Computing:** Processes data closer to users.

## 12. What is High Availability? ⏳
- **Definition:** Ensuring a system remains operational even if some components fail.
- **Methods:**
  - Redundant servers.
  - Failover mechanisms.
  - Backup and disaster recovery.

## 13. What is Disaster Recovery? 🛠️
- **Definition:** Strategies to restore services after a failure.
- **Techniques:**
  - Regular backups.
  - Failover systems.
  - Cloud-based disaster recovery solutions.

## 14. What is the difference between Monolithic and Distributed Architecture? ⚙️
| Feature       | Monolithic Architecture 🏩 | Distributed Architecture 🌍 |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Scalability  | Harder to scale | Easier to scale |
| Deployment  | Simple but slow | Complex but flexible |
| Fault Tolerance | Low | High |
| Development Speed | Slower | Faster (independent teams) |

## 15. What are common server bottlenecks and how to fix them? 🚦
- **CPU Overload:** Optimize queries, reduce processing load.
- **Memory Limitations:** Increase RAM, use caching.
- **Database Slowdowns:** Indexing, database replication.
- **Network Latency:** Use CDNs, optimize APIs.
