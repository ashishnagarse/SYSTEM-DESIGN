# 📌 Database Types & Scaling - Interview Questions & Answers  

## 1️⃣ What is a Relational Database (RDBMS)?  
A **Relational Database** organizes data into structured tables (rows & columns) with relationships between them. It ensures **data integrity** and follows **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles.  

💡 **Example Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server  

✅ **Use Cases:**  
- Banking & Financial Applications 💰  
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems 🏢  
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Tools 📊  

---

## 2️⃣ What is a NoSQL Database?  
A **NoSQL Database** is a flexible, schema-less database designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data. It offers high **scalability** and **eventual consistency**.  

💡 **Types of NoSQL Databases:**  
- **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB) 📜  
- **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) 🔑  
- **Column Stores** (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase) 📊  
- **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) 🔗  

✅ **Use Cases:**  
- Real-time analytics 📈  
- Social media applications 📱  
- IoT & Big Data processing 🌐

## 3️⃣ When to Choose SQL vs. NoSQL?  

| Feature             | SQL (RDBMS) ✅ | NoSQL ❌ |
|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Data Structure**  | Structured 📋 | Unstructured / Semi-structured 📜 |
| **Schema**          | Fixed Schema 📑 | Dynamic Schema 🔄 |
| **Scalability**     | Vertical (Scale-Up) 📊 | Horizontal (Scale-Out) ⚡ |
| **Transactions**    | ACID-Compliant ✅ | Eventual Consistency 🔄 |
| **Query Language**  | SQL (Structured Queries) 📌 | Varies (NoSQL Query Language, JSON) 📝 |

💡 **General Guidelines:**  
✔ Use **SQL** if you need **strong consistency** & **structured data**.  
✔ Use **NoSQL** if you need **scalability, fast writes, and flexibility**.

## 4️⃣ What is Database Scaling? Why is it Important?  
**Database Scaling** refers to increasing the database’s capacity to handle high traffic and large data loads efficiently. It ensures **high availability**, **low latency**, and **optimal performance**.  

✅ **Types of Scaling:**  
1️⃣ **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)** – Adding more CPU, RAM, or SSDs to a single server.  
2️⃣ **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)** – Adding multiple servers to distribute the load.  

💡 **Example:**  
- **Vertical Scaling** – Upgrading from 16GB RAM to 64GB RAM.  
- **Horizontal Scaling** – Adding 5 more database servers to handle traffic.  

---

## 5️⃣ What is a Load Balancer, and How Does It Work?  
A **Load Balancer** is a system that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and **improve performance & reliability**.  

✅ **Benefits of Load Balancers:**  
- Ensures **high availability** 🌍  
- Reduces **downtime** ⚡  
- Improves **fault tolerance** 🛡  

💡 **Example Load Balancers:** Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB  

---

## 6️⃣ What is Database Sharding?  
**Sharding** is a technique of **splitting a large database** into smaller, **faster, and more manageable parts** (shards). Each shard is stored on a separate server to improve scalability and performance.  

✅ **Benefits of Sharding:**  
- Faster **query performance** ⚡  
- Enables **horizontal scaling** 🔄  
- Avoids single points of failure 🚀  

💡 **Example:**  
A **social media app** with millions of users might shard the database **based on user ID ranges**.  

---

## 7️⃣ What is the CAP Theorem?  
The **CAP Theorem** states that a distributed database can only guarantee **two out of three**:  

1️⃣ **Consistency (C)** – All nodes show the latest data at any given time.  
2️⃣ **Availability (A)** – The system remains operational even if some nodes fail.  
3️⃣ **Partition Tolerance (P)** – The system continues to function despite network failures.  

💡 **Database Examples:**  
- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** MongoDB, HBase  
- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** Cassandra, DynamoDB  
- **CA (Consistency + Availability):** Traditional SQL Databases  

---

## 8️⃣ What is Indexing, and Why is it Important?  
**Indexing** improves **database performance** by allowing faster retrieval of records. It works like an index in a book, pointing to data locations without scanning the entire table.  

✅ **Types of Indexes:**  
- **Primary Index:** Automatically created for the primary key.  
- **Secondary Index:** Created manually for frequently queried columns.  
- **Composite Index:** Covers multiple columns in a query.  

💡 **Example:**  
If a database has a **users table** with millions of records, an index on the `email` field allows **fast lookup** instead of scanning every row.  

---

## 9️⃣ What is Database Replication?  
**Replication** is the process of creating multiple copies of a database to improve **availability, backup, and load balancing**.  

✅ **Types of Replication:**  
1️⃣ **Master-Slave Replication** – One primary database (Master) replicates to secondary databases (Slaves).  
2️⃣ **Multi-Master Replication** – Multiple databases act as **both master and replica**.  
3️⃣ **Read-Replica Replication** – Used for read-heavy applications to distribute queries.  

💡 **Use Cases:**  
- **Disaster Recovery** 🔄  
- **Load Balancing in High-Traffic Applications** 🚀  

---

## 🔟 What is a Connection Pool?  
A **Connection Pool** is a cache of database connections **ready for reuse**, reducing the overhead of creating new connections for every request.  

✅ **Benefits:**  
- Reduces **latency** 🚀  
- Improves **performance** ⚡  
- Saves **system resources** 🔄  

💡 **Example Libraries:**  
- Java: HikariCP  
- Python: SQLAlchemy Connection Pool
